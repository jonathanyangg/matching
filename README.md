# Tour Guide Prospective Student Matching

Welcome to **Tour Guide Prospective Student Matching**, a tool designed to seamlessly pair tour guides with prospective students using semantic search. Whether you're running campus tours or planning personalized visits, this project simplifies the process, ensuring each prospective student is matched with the ideal guide.

**How It Works**

Upload Your Data: Provide details about both your tour guides and prospective students.

Leverage Semantic Search: Our system uses advanced algorithms to understand and match profiles based on key attributes, preferences, and compatibility.

Get Tailored Matches: Receive optimized pairings that enhance the campus tour experience for everyone.
With this tool, you can focus on creating memorable visits while the system handles the complexity of matching!

**How To Use It**

Our tour guide matching tool is currently deployed at https://matching-ndwd.onrender.com/

Ensure that the files you upload are .csv files. The system processes your CSV files as follows:

- First column: Name of the individual (tour guide or prospective student)
- Second column: Gender
- Third column: Grade/Year
- All remaining columns: Used as data points for matching

The system automatically processes all additional columns as matching criteria, so feel free to include any relevant attributes that would help create optimal matches.
